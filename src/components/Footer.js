                    <p>I am a Software Engineer out of Atlanta, GA. I moved here in June 2019 after 7 years in Nashville, TN as a music producer and engineer. My passion for software has always been bubbling beneath the surface. It really began to show once I started working in a recording studio. How could I get more out of the software I was using and how far can this tool be stretched? <br />Upon moving to Atlanta, I found General Assembly, and an opportunity to take my curiousity/questions and turn them into something concrete and practical. My love for crafting and creating carried over seemlessly from audio engineering to software engineering. A dedication to my craft, and fervent joy towards learning continue to propel me forward.
