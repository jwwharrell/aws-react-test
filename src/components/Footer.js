                    <p>I am an excited and optimistic new student at General Assembly's Atlanta campus. I am studying software
                      engineering, and beginning a path towards a new career. Listed to the left are empty project links, that
                      hopefully, over the next several weeks, will begin to fill with applications that will interest more than
                      myself!
